# üî• NetAegis ‚Äì Python-based Personal Firewall for Kali Linux

NetAegis is a powerful and interactive personal firewall tool developed in Python. It allows users to monitor, filter, block, and log suspicious or unwanted network traffic. Built specifically for **Kali Linux environments**, it leverages `iptables`, `arptables`, and `Scapy` to provide in-depth packet control and auditing functionality ‚Äî all from a terminal interface.

## üìå Project Highlights

- üîê **Real-time firewall control** (block by IP, port, or protocol)
- üì¶ **Generates `.pcap` files** compatible with Wireshark for traffic auditing
- üß† **Smart input validation** (IP, port, protocol) to prevent errors
- üõ†Ô∏è All essential **firewall actions in one interface**
- üìä **Automatic traffic summaries** with protocol/IP stats
- üíæ **Persistent rule management** via `rules.json`
- üßæ **Event logging** with time-stamped actions

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Scapy** (for packet sniffing and inspection)
- **iptables & arptables** (Linux-level traffic control)
- **Kali Linux OS** (recommended platform)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Root Access Required

To work with packet capturing and modify system firewall settings, **NetAegis requires root privileges**.

Use the following command to run:

```bash
sudo python3 netaegis.py
```

> Without `sudo`, the firewall will not be able to generate `.pcap` capture files or apply firewall rules correctly.

## üìÅ Auto-Generated Files

The following files will be **automatically created when you initialize and run the project**:

| File Name             | Description                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `rules.json`          | Stores all block rules (IPs, ports, protocols)     |
| `firewall_log.txt`    | Log of all events, blocks, actions                 |
| `capture.pcap`        | Saved packet capture (open in Wireshark)          |
| `capture_summary.txt` | Text summary of the captured packets              |

---

## üì¶ Required Python Libraries

```
scapy
pyfiglet
```

---

## üß∞ Required Kali Linux Packages

Ensure these tools are pre-installed (default in Kali Linux):

- `iptables`
- `arptables`

Install them if missing:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables arptables
```
